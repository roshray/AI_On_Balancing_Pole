# BalancingPole
The idea of B_Pole is that there is a pole standing up on top of a cart. The goal is to balance this pole by wiggling/moving the cart from side to side to keep the pole balanced upright.  The environment is deemed successful if we can balance for 200 frames, and failure is deemed when the pole is more than 15 degrees from fully vertical.
